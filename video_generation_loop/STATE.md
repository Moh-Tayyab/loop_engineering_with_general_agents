# STATE.md — Video Generation Loop (project spine)

> This is the **project spine** for `video_generation_loop/` — the back of that diary.
> Read `video_generation_loop/AGENTS.md` (rules) then this file (progress); update THIS file
> last when a beat touches the video loop. There is no root STATE.md or root AGENTS.md —
> this spine pair is fully self-contained (rules + budget live in this loop's `AGENTS.md`).
> (Nested-spine split decided 2026-09-14, beat 28; root files removed beat 30, 2026-09-15.)

## 1. Project Identity

- **Project:** `video_generation_loop/` — daily 60-second shorts via Google Flow automation.
- **Scope:** template/Gemini planners → storyboard → Flow Clip generation (PAID Google
  account) → ffmpeg merge/eval → 4-platform post package → YouTube private scheduled upload.
- **Stack:** Python 3.12, Playwright Flow, ffmpeg/ffprobe, Google APIs, pytest.
- **First real upload:** 2026-08-31 (videoId pT7ziFDM_yc, day_03 synthetic).
- **CI gate:** `.github/workflows/test-gate.yml` runs this loop's tests
  (installs its requirements; `python -m pytest -q video_generation_loop/tests`).

## 2. Current Beat

- **Beat #:** 31 — weekday 09:00 heartbeat: morning triage (shared trainer infra, owned by job loop)
- **Date:** 2026-09-28
- **Trigger:** schedule — `opencode.yml` cron `0 9 * * 1-5` (fired ~17:30Z, 8.5h late)
- **Status:** **No video-loop code touched — MAKER DONE on shared infra, HUMAN GATE.** The morning
  loop's mandated step 2 (`gh run list --workflow=test-gate.yml`) is **unreadable in CI (HTTP 403)**:
  the `autonomous` job in `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` declares no `actions` scope. Minimal fix
  (`actions: read`, read-only) prepared on `fix/heartbeat-actions-read` (`7044780`) but **not landed**:
  the `checker` spawn failed (no APPROVED verdict → no PR, §2 rule 1) and the push was rejected because
  a GitHub App token cannot edit `.github/workflows/**` without `workflows` scope. **Consequence for
  THIS loop: `test-gate.yml` results for `video_generation_loop/tests` cannot be read by any beat, so
  §6.1's "PR with failing tests is CHANGES REQUESTED" check is currently unenforceable — treat any
  video PR as unverified until a human lands job loop §10 task 20.** Details + human decision:
  `job_fetching_loop/STATE.md` §10 task 20 (owner).

## 4. Budget & Stopping Conditions

Same ceilings as the trainer (shared loop budgets) — see THIS loop's `AGENTS.md` §3.
Project-specific note: video beats cost REAL MONEY (PAID Google account); never run an
accidental watch/generation. Budget counter is shared with the job loop.

## 5–8. Maker–Checker, Inner/Outer, Automation, Escalation

All defined in THIS loop's `AGENTS.md` (§2 non-negotiables, §5 inner/outer, §6 hardened
maker–checker, §7 escalation). Single source of truth — do not restate here.

## 9. State Compression

Cap this project's beat log at 20 rows; compress into a one-line "Legacy beats" summary when
exceeded. Keep verdicts; never drop budget (§4) or escalation (THIS loop's `AGENTS.md` §7).

## 10. Next Actionable Tasks (video loop)

1. **G5 supervised live run (the last gate):** `FLOW_PLANNER=template FLOW_HEADLESS=0
   .venv/bin/python -m src.main` on a fresh day (concept-03); accept 6/6 real clips →
   merge → post package → `--upload-today` (tombstone `done` + video_id).
   Use `docs/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`.
2. **YouTube re-consent:** `.venv/bin/python -m src.main --youtube-auth` (token from
   2026-08-31 past Google testing-mode ~7d expiry).
3. Decide stale PRs: #5 (wrap_text), #7 (redact fix), #8 (issue #6 fix) — merge or close.
4. **rclone Drive sync** (laptop-off design): GitHub cron pulls clips/uploads/syncs back
   with the laptop off — still pending.
5. `_approve_credits` live verification on the credit dialog (part of G5).
6. Beat 6-12 follow-ups (verify-loop-state graduation) remain available.
7. **(2026-09-24, shared infra — owned by job loop Beat 116):** retired `checker` model
   `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free` was fixed to `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free` in
   `.opencode/agent/checker.md`; this loop's `AGENTS.md` §11 lesson line was updated to
   match (consistency only, no video-loop behavior change). Verify the Checker spawn works
   next session before this loop's next maker–checker cycle.
8. **(2026-09-28, shared infra — owned by job loop Beat 143, BLOCKING for this loop):** the
   heartbeat cannot read CI (HTTP 403 on `gh run list`/check-runs) because the `autonomous` job
   in `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` lacks `actions: read`. Until a human lands the one-line fix
   (job loop §10 task 20), **no beat can verify this loop's `test-gate.yml` result** — so treat any
   video PR as unverified, and do not merge one on an unverified gate. `checker` subagent spawn is
   also still broken (3rd occurrence), so video maker→checker cycles cannot complete either.

## 11. Human Gate Decisions (video loop)

- 2026-08-31 — **PAID Google account.** Every video generation costs real money; never
  generate from a non-approved storyboard topic; never topic-derive a video.
- 2026-08-31 — **Video style = presenter + narration.** Presenter (young man) from
  reference images; explainer + presenter + clean studio bg + blue accents +
  "Narrate / Lip-sync exactly: '<Urdu text>'".
- 2026-08-31 — **Reference images** live in `references/`: use the presenter image ONLY
  when the scene needs the on-screen presenter; purely visual scenes must NOT force it.
- 2026-08-31 — **Flow presenter = Characters (MCP-verified).** Raw file upload ≠ presenter;
  must go through `Characters → Add from Project`. Implemented fail-closed in
  `_ensure_presenter_character` (paid-account guard).
- 2026-08-31 — **Presenter prompt TEMPLATE** (user-approved) — the exact wording for
  presenter scenes is pinned in the human-gate record (§11 below, legacy beats 14–18).
- 2026-09-14 — **Unattended runs must default to the template planner.** `FLOW_PLANNER=gemini-web`
  hangs at planner stage with no human; production `.env` = `template`.
